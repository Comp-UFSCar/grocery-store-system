# Grocery-store-system (Projeto Mercado)

This repository was created for the final assignment of the Tópicos Avançados(Advanced Topics) A-2015/1 course at UFSCar. The goal of this assignment was to code a simple cashier system based on a UML diagram provided by the professor, respecting all of the system requirements passed by him. The team was free to use the most appropriated methodology for the tests, and we chose a bottom-up approach for tests, because the development strategy was similar.
